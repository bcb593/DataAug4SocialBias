Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
male words: Male-gendered words typically refer to words that are associated with or specifically denote male entities or qualities. These entities could be gender specific nouns and pronouns, male title and terms of address. You can't be biased interms of occupation.

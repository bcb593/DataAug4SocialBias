Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences by extracting the gender words. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Below is instruction for you on how to extract the words and generate new sentences.

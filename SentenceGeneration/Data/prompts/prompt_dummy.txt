Your goal is first to generate sentences for two different social groups as following: 
i. First out the words might be the reasonable ones for the gender related words. 
ii. Filter out these selected words by giving reasons. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Donot generate anything else, just take the prompt and excatly generate according to the pattern. 
Here is the instruction. 
#Original Sentence#: He is an engineer working on a construction firm working with his wife. 
In the #Original Setence#, He, his, wife, engineer are the most probable gender related words. Engineer is a occupation, so it is not gender related word. Therefore, the gender related words are he, his, wife. 
Thus, 
 {For the same social group: 
  Instructions (The gender related words are from the all words from above update accordingly): he--> he, his-> his , wife--> wife,  keep these constant and create a diverse sentence. 
  Generated sentence: He is an engineer working on a renowned construction firm working his wife, both being life and job partners. }
{For the opposite social group:
    Instructions(These gender related words are from the all words from above update accordingly): he--> she, his-> her , wife--> husband, change the sentence in same social group by switching these words by creating a diverse sentence.  
    Generated sentence: She is an engineer working on a renowned construction firm working her husband, both being life and job partners. 
    }

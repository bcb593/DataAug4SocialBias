Your goal is to generate sentences for different social groups given an original sentence. 
<Here is instruction.>
#Original Sentence#: He is an engineer working on a construction firm working with his wife. 
In the #Original Setence#, He, his, wife are the gender related words. Engineer is a occupation, so it is not gender related word. 
Thus, 
 {For the same social group: 
  Instructions (The gender related words are from the all words from above update accordingly): he--> he, his-> his , wife--> wife,  keep these constant and create a diverse sentence. 
  Generated sentence: He is an engineer working on a renowned construction firm working his wife, both being life and job partners. }
{For the opposite social group:
    Instructions(These gender related words are from the all words from above update accordingly): he--> she, his-> her , wife--> husband, change the sentence in same social group by switching these words by creating a diverse sentence.  
    Generated sentence: She is an engineer working on a renowned construction firm working her husband, both being life and job partners. 
    }

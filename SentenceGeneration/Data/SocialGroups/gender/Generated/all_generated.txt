Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are : man, men, male, boy, he 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are: woman, women, she, female, girl
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example.

"when sexuality is kept private and directed in ways seen as sacred – and when one’s hubby isn’t seeing hers hubby (or other women) half-naked all day long – one can feel great power and intensity when the headscarf or the chador comes off in the sanctity of the home."Output:

Please let me know if you need any further clarification.
Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are : man, men, male, boy, he 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are: woman, women, she, female, girl
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example.

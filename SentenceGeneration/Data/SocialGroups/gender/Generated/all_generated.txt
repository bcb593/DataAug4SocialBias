Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are : man, men, male, boy, he 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are: woman, women, she, female, girl
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example.

    Generated sentence: In may 2013, she reported that “the results of austerity had been “what any keynesian would have expected: hardly any growth in the uk … in the last two and a half years … little reduction in public deficits, despite large spending cuts;…higher national debts… [and] prolonged unemployment.” Until 1981, france had a clear division between right and left.

Please let me know if you have any question.
Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are : man, men, male, boy, he 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun. Examples are: woman, women, she, female, girl
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example.

Please note that the instructions are given in the format of a code block, with the input and output sentences being the focus of the task. The goal is to extract gender words from the input sentence and generate two new sentences, one for the same gender group and one for the opposite gender group. The generated sentences should be longer and more diverse than the input sentence, and should include all the new words that were extracted from the input sentence.

The input sentence is "Asia's policymakers can encourage women's leadership in technology and finance, where female participation is increasingly vital."

The output for the same gender group should be:
"Asia's policymakers can encourage women's leadership in technology and finance, where female participation is increasingly vital, empowering them to break new ground and drive innovation in these traditionally male-dominated fields."

The output for the opposite gender group should be:
"Asia's policymakers can encourage men's leadership in technology and finance, where male participation is increasingly vital, harnessing their unique skills and perspectives to foster progress and competitiveness in these rapidly evolving sectors."

Please note that the gender words, male words, and female words should be extracted and used accordingly in the generated sentences. Also, the sentences should be grammatically correct and coherent.

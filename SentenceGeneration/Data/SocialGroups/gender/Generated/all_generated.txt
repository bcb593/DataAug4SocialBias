Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences by extracting the gender words. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender or masuline explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender or feminie explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun.

Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences by extracting the gender words. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Please focus on the following explanation during the extraction of gender words:
Gender Words: Any words that represents the male, female or any form of gender explicitly. The gender words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The gender words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Male Words: Any words representing the male gender or masuline explicitly. The male words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The male words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Female Words: Any words representing the female gender or feminie explicitly. The female words can't be any occupation, nationalities, verbs or adjectives. The female words are usually noun and pronoun. 
Below is instruction for you on how to extract the words and generate new sentences.

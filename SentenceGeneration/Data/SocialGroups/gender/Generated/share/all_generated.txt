Your goal is first to generate sentences from the given prompt sentence #original Sentence # with reasoning for two different social groups as following: 
i. First generate a sentence similar to the #original sentence# which is longer and diverse based on the #original sentence# by providing reasons during each step. 
ii. Similarly, generate a sentence which is of opposite gender group by following: 
   a.  Find out the gender words in the #Generated Sentence for Same Social Group#
   b. In Step1, Provide reasoning why each words are selected as gender related words based on the explanation of the gender related words given in the prompt #Explanation#. 
   c. In Step2, filter out the random words which are detected as gender related words but are not actually based on explanation of the gender related words in #Explanation#. 
The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
You should focus on providing correct reasoning in each step shown in the instruction.
#Explantion#: Gender related words should be related to explicitly to either male or female gender. Certain occupations can't be certain gender related words.

{For the opposite social group by creating gender parallel words:
  Step1: What are the gender realted words in the Generated Sentence?
  ans: he, his, wife
  Step2: Why is not engineer gender related word? 
  ans: From explanation of gender realted word: it should be related to explicitly to either male or female gender. Certain occupation can't be certain gender related words. 
  Generated sentence: She is an engineer working on a renowned construction firm working her husband, both being life and job partners.

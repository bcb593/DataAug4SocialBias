Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example. 
Below is instruction for you on how to extract the words and generate new sentences.

Note: Please note that the above instructions are for demonstration purpose only. You should not use any gendered language or make any assumptions about the gender of the individuals mentioned in the prompt. Please use gender-neutral language and focus on the skills, abilities, and perspectives of the individuals, rather than their gender.
Your goal is first to extract gender related words from the prompt. 
After extraction, you need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same gender group and opposite gender group in following way:
i. First extract the words in the prompt which are gender related and update them in the gender words
ii. Similarly, divide them in the male words and female words section. 
iii. Generate two sentences, one for same gender and another for the different gender by flipping words. 
iv. The generated sentences should be longer and diverse with all the new words which are not in the prompt sentence. 
Important: The original sentence might not contain any gender related words in the sentences, you can write 'None' as shown in the example. 
Below is instruction for you on how to extract the words and generate new sentences. 
<Here is instruction.>
#Original Sentence#: Asia's policymakers can encourage women's leadership in technology and finance, where female participation is increasingly vital.
Output:
Extracting gender words from the #Original Sentence#. Please don't be bias. 
{{Gender words:

            {female words: women's, female },
 {For the same social group: 
  Instructions: women's--> women's, female--> female , keep these constant
  Generated sentence: Asia's policymakers can encourage women's leadership in technology and finance, where female participation is increasingly vital, empowering them to break new ground and drive innovation in these traditionally male-dominated fields.
}, 
{For the opposite social group:
    Instructions: women's-->men's, female-->male, change the sentence in same social group by switching these words. 
    Generated sentence: Asia's policymakers can encourage men's leadership in technology and finance, where male participation is increasingly vital, harnessing their unique skills and perspectives to foster progress and competitiveness in these rapidly evolving sectors.

Original prompt: "For them, individualism is a fundamental aspect of their identity, and they believe that personal freedom and autonomy are essential for a fulfilling life."

Rewritten prompt (opposite social group): "For them, collectivism is the foundation of their identity, and they believe that the well-being of the group is paramount to individual happiness."

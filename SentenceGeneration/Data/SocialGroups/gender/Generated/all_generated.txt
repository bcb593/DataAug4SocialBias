Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group.  
The given sentence in the prompt sentence might contain social group such as race, gender with their respective attributes. 
While rewritting don't change the words which are attributes for the particular social group. 
Your objective is to rewrite a given prompt make it high quality and make it more diverse and longer sentences. 
Remeber to put similar attributes for both same and oppostie groups during generation. The generated sentences should contain same attributes with both genders in both group sentences. 
One more important task is to keep the original sentence in prompt as close to the generated ones. Don't add sentences from the given prompt in the generated sentences. These are just the examples in one case, adding similar words might not be relevant with other sentences.

I want you act as a Prompt Creator.
Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group.  
The given sentence in the prompt sentence might contain social group such as race, gender with their respective attributes. 
While rewritting don't change the words which are attributes for the particular social group. 
Your objective is to rewrite a given prompt make it high quality and make it more diverse and longer sentences. 
Remeber to put similar attributes for both same and oppostie groups during generation. The generated sentences should contain same attributes with both genders in both group sentences. 
One more important task is to keep the original sentence in prompt as close to the generated ones. Don't add sentences from the given prompt in the generated sentences. These are just the examples in one case, adding similar words might not be relevant with other sentences.

I want you act as a Prompt Creator.
Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group.  
The given sentence in the prompt sentence might contain social group such as race, gender with their respective attributes. 
While rewritting don't change the words which are attributes for the particular social group. 
Your objective is to rewrite a given prompt make it high quality and make it more diverse and longer sentences. 
Remeber to put similar attributes for both same and oppostie groups during generation. The generated sentences should contain same attributes with both genders in both group sentences. 
One more important task is to keep the original sentence in prompt as close to the generated ones. Don't add sentences from the given prompt in the generated sentences. These are just the examples in one case, adding similar words might not be relevant with other sentences.

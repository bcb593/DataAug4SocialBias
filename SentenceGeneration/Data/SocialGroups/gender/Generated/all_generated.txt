Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Original Sentence# to create two different sentences. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group.  
The given sentence in the prompt sentence might contain social group such as race, gender with their respective attributes.

This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Original Sentence#. 
You need to generate sentences for two cases, one for same social group and opposite social group.  
The given sentence in the prompt sentence might contain social group such as race, gender with their respective attributes.
